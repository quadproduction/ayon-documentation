## Sync status from Version to Task
More informations [here](module_ftrack/#sync-status-from-version-to-task.md).

## Update status from Version to Task
Updates Task status based on status changes on it's `AssetVersion`.

The issue this solves is when Asset version's status is changed but the artist assigned to Task is looking at the task status, thus not noticing the review.

This event makes sure statuses Asset Version get synced to it's task. After changing a status on version, this event first tries to set identical status to version's parent (usually task). At this moment there are a few more status mappings hardcoded into the system. If Asset version's status was changed to:

-   `Reviewed` then Task's status will be changed to `Change requested`
-   `Approved` then Task's status will be changed to `Complete`
