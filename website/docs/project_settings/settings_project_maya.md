# Open Workfile Post Initialization
Open the Workfile on Maya's launch. This changes default behaviour of opening last Workfile (that works by passing Workfile as argument when launching Maya). When enabled, last Workfile is loaded after Maya is fully initialized. This can help in certain scenarios where Workfile depends on Maya plugins that are not fully initialized yet when the scene is already opened.

# Explicit Plugins Loading
Determine the plugins to load on Maya's launch.

# Color Management (OCIO managed)
//

# Maya MEL Workspace
Text to set in the MEL Workspace file.

# Extension Mapping
Save a family (on left) as the indicated extension (on right). 

![Extension Mapping](assets/settings_project_maya_extension_mapping.png)

# Maya Directory Mapping
1. Enable it to use the environment variables in the referenced paths.
2. Put here your Path
3. Put here your desination path

The **source path** will be replaced by the **destination path**.

# Include/Exclude Handles in default playback & render range
1. Enable or disable the inclusion of handles by default.
2. You can also define the inclusion/exclusion of handles by task type.

# Scripts Menu Definition
Build a menu in Maya.
![Script Menu Definition](assets/settings_project_maya_ScriptMenuDefinition.png)

For example here: 
- **Menu Name :** Write your menu name
- **Menu Definition :**

→ "type": define the button type. Here, it's an action because when you click on it, it directly loads another window or commit any other action you defined in your script. 
*(if you define the type as a "menu", you can unfold the button to see other buttons and define them as actions).*

![Menu](assets/settings_project_maya_PublishGUIFilters_Menu.png)

→ "command": define the command to implement the script in the button.

→ "sourcetype": define the programming language of the script.

→ "title": define the button title (here it's "Edit shader name definitions")

→ "tooltip": pass your cursor on the "Edit shader name definitions" to have a tip written at the bottom of Maya's interface.

![Tool Tip](assets/settings_project_maya_ScriptMenuDefinition_ToolTip.png)

→ "tags": keywords to type on the search bar to find an option. Here, type "pipeline" or "shader" to find the "Edit shader name definition".

# Render Settings

- Enable or disable the **Apply Render Settings on creation** option.

- **Context section:** filtres for subset name (regex accepted), families, representation names and available Loader plugin.

- **Linked Assets/Shots:** filters for asset builds to be added
