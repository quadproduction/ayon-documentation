Set regex pattern(s) only for task names when publishing of Palettes should occur.

### Validate Audio

If you are sure that you want to send render without audio, you can
disable this plugin by toggle next to plugin name.

If enabled, artist might decide to disable validation for each publish (for special use cases).
